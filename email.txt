 NEW CANAAN, CT — Stand Together Against Racism (S.T.A.R.), in partnership with The Glass House and the Carriage Barn Arts Center, recently announced its second annual student "Through Your Looking Glass" Art Showcase. According to a news release provided by the New Canaan-based non-profit, the art showcase seeks to recognize the role of art, design and/or architecture in advancing social justice through the lens of inclusion, equity and diversity. Students in all grades, including college, from all towns in Fairfield County, are invited to create and submit art that reflects the social justice topics that matter most to them today. Art can include paintings, drawings, photography, mixed media, sculpture, videos/film (including TikTok style) or architectural renderings. "We are thrilled to partner with S.T.A.R. for the second time on this exciting program," Christa Carr, communications director at The Glass House, said in a news release. "As we saw last year, the range of social justice topics that matter to students is vast and eye-opening, and the creativity and excitement we saw was enlightening. I'd encourage everyone to visit the S.T.A.R. website to see last year's art and the student's stories about the art." According to S.T.A.R, this is a true showcase, not a contest. All student art will be exhibited at the Carriage Barn Arts Center in New Canaan. The showcase opens with a reception on Oct. 28 from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m., which students, family, friends and community members are welcome to attend. The reception, and admission to the showcase, is free of charge. "We are honored to partner with S.T.A.R to present this social justice student art showcase and look forward to seeing the art from students across all of Fairfield County," Carriage Barn Arts Center Executive Director Hilary Whittmann said in a news release. "We're big believers that visual arts truly can enrich a community and we invite all to come experience the exhibit." The exhibit will conclude on Nov. 11, concurrent with a new event this year featuring inspiring local artists who will share their art journey and lead participants in a hands-on, interactive art making session. Featured artists to-date include Tara Blackwell, Brian Kaspr, Julio Pardo and Butch Quick. Students should register in advance to show their intent to submit their art. Physical art or videos and the mandatory release form are due by Oct. 23. The forms and additional information can be found at star-ct.org. Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox.

Scraped article text: In Memory of Francis New London - Francis Augustus (Gus) Seamans of New London, NH passed away peacefully on September 18, 2023. He was the loving husband of Mary (MJ) Page Seamans with whom he shared nearly 65 years of marriage, prior to her death in April 2015.
Born on September 11, 1927, Gus, son of Richard Dodge and Nathalie Gifford Seamans, and descendant of Elder Job Seamans, was raised in Salem, MA. Gus outlived his three siblings, living well to 96 years. Gus and MJ's love of sailing was nurtured in their youth where they raced competitively in the same boat class in Marblehead Harbor. Gus graduated from the Phillips Exeter Academy, Exeter, NH and from Harvard University in Cambridge, MA, where he proudly attended his 60th reunion with former classmates in 2009.
Gus and Mary were married in 1950 and raised their four children primarily in Denver, CO and New Canaan, CT with short stints in Texas, Oklahoma and California, all courtesy of Gus's lifelong career at Texaco, Inc. He was an accomplished geophysicist and served as VIce President of Exploration, which involved significant global travel. Gus enjoyed sight seeing so he and MJ often loaded their family in the station wagon for many memorable road trips, including numerous thrilling mountain passes as well as trips to New England to visit extended family. Gus drove out of his way to visit state and national parks, and historic sites. In CO, both Gus and MJ patiently taught their children to ski, lace up boots and all, spending nearly every weekend skiing with family friends. While living in CT, Gus and MJ reignited their passion for sailing, which they shared with their children while racing Atlantic class sailboats every weekend on Long Island Sound. In 1992, Gus and MJ retired to New London, NH where they were active and involved in their community, always modeling the importance of giving back. Gus served on the New London Sewer Commission, and as Board member of The Fells Historic Estate, where he also spent countless hours volunteering. Gus spent 25 years as an AARP tax preparer, where his mastery of numbers and Excel served him well. He was a master craftsman, sharing those skills with his sons, completing numerous home improvement projects with and for his children, and volunteering for Habitat for Humanity.
Gus and MJ passed along their love of the great outdoors to their children and grandchildren. Gus enjoyed sailing, skiing, hiking, gardening, and golfing. He was an avid card player, favoring bridge, and enjoyed a weekly competitive bridge group well into his 90's. He shared his love of cards and puzzles with his entire family, always willing to drop anything to play cribbage (or any game) with family and dear friends. Those close to him admired his smarts, interest in lifelong learning (a dedicated Adventures in Learning student), appreciation and knowledge of classical music, commitment to faith and church, and his giving spirit. Gus-Gus's loving children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren will honor his memory by trying to live by his example -- enjoying family, friends, nature, and life while always giving back.
Gus is survived by his four children, Stephen and Debi (Wilmot, NH); David (Scottsdale, AZ); Wendy Bardet and Mark (Granite Bay, CA); Tim and Dori (Southport, NC); 11 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.
A private service was held with Gus's family. A celebration of his life will be announced. In lieu of flowers, please honor his memory with donations to St. Andrew's Church or The Lake Sunapee Region VNA & Hospice.

	 « All Events In April 1975, just days before South Vietnam fell to the North, Ralph White, just 27-years old, was the newly-appointed manager of Chase Manhattan’s Saigon branch. His assignment was to keep the Saigon branch open as long as possible and evacuate key staff, if necessary.
White, the author of “Getting Out of Saigon,” will describe for New Canaan Men’s Club members, how he accomplished the mission in the chaotic last days, helping 113 employees and their families escape, before the city fell to the North Vietnamese Army.
The Men’s Club will hear from White at its Friday’s meeting in Morrill Hall of St. Mark’s Episcopal Church. The meeting begins at 10 a.m., with White’s remarks scheduled for around 10:40 a.m.
In his first days in Saigon, White took over the bank’s Saigon branch, met its Vietnamese staff and introduced himself to various government officials, including senior U.S. Embassy diplomats, CIA officials, and the military.
But to evacuate the Chase employees, he had to devise a plan so they could leave despite the fact that they didn’t have exit visas. As described in his book, White was able to get the employees out of Saigon thanks to an ingenious plan and support from Chase, which later helped the employees find jobs and housing in the U.S.
Since leaving Chase, White earned an MBA from Columbia University and has written three novels, in addition to his nonfiction account of the Saigon evacuation, subtitled, “How a 27-Year-Old American Banker Saved 113 Vietnamese Civilians.”

	 Roma E. Le Blanc Sr. died peacefully in the hospital, surrounded by family and friends, on Thursday, September 21, 2023. He was 80 years old. Roma E. Le Blanc Sr. He was survived by his sons, Roma Jr (Karen), Michael (Jennifer) and his grandsons, Jake, Louis, and Mason as well as many nieces, nephews, great nieces, and great nephews. He was the youngest of 13 and predeceased by his siblings as well as his wife of 54 years, Phyllis Le Blanc Roma was born in Wedgeport, Canada and has spent his adult life in New Canaan, CT. He loved both countries and recently enjoyed what he called “ a trip of a lifetime” back home to Canada, accompanied by his son, Michael. He was a plant operator for the town of New Canaan, retiring after 34 years of dedicated service. Roma was known as a true friend to all who knew him. He was there for everyone and always managed to find the time to help anyone who asked him. He was a generous soul who would offer the shirt off his back to someone in need. He never had a lot but was always happy and grateful for what he had. He loved to spend time with his family and to keep busy and even in retirement he never stopped. He enjoyed being outside and working with his hands. His joy in life was his grandchildren. A part of Roma was missing since he lost Phyllis in April. His family hopes he has found peace now. There will be a gathering to remember Roma E. Le Blanc Sr. at Hoyt Funeral Home in New Canaan, CT,  On Friday the 29th of September. Family will be available from 4pm-7pm. There will be a dinner afterward at The Norwalk Inn at 7:30 pm for those who wish to attend. Don’t remember Roma with sadness or tears but with the laughter that he shared with us.
Don’t think about the things that we didn’t get to say to him but think about the great times we had with him.
Roma was a gardener at heart. He loved to plant his gardens and proudly watch them grow.
Plant a perennial in your yard so every spring when it reappears you will be reminded of the love and friendship that he brought into our lives. Perfect, Jim. Thanks Always a smile and a hello!!!! Rest Roma. I will remember Roma by his examples of kindness and willingness to be helpful no matter what day or time of day. RIP my friend Michael, Roma and family. Allan and I are so very sorry to hear about your dad. He was a wonderful and thoughtful man who loved everyone. May he rest in peace God bless you all. Maria and Allan Russo.

	 L-R: Lina Welch, Brigida and Chris Falsetta, and Nancy Welch at the N.C. Combine/Gracie Fund tent at New Canaan Sidewalk Sale, 2023. It’s almost here. The New Canaan Combine is to be held at 9:30 a.m. Sunday at Dunning Field (come down at 9 a.m. for coffee and donuts with New Canaan first responders, courtesy of Dunkin’). Organized by New Canaan’s House of Telos, the Combine will be emceed by New Canaan’s Chris Russo. It’s a friendly athletic competition between the New Canaan Police and Fire Departments that brings in EMTs and members of the community. This year, the Combine benefits the Gracie Fund for Pediatric Cancer through sponsorships, merchandise sales, donations and a silent auction that went live here on Sunday. Founded by the Falsetta family following a diagnosis of leukemia in their 12-year-old daughter last year, the Gracie Fund has already earned support from local businesses including Plum Plums Cheese and JMG Insurance, and the Combine has brought in additional organizations and volunteers to make it the biggest event yet. We first connected with Gracie’s dad, Chris Falsetta, back in May to hear about the Gracie Fund and Combine. On Sunday, with just one week to go, we get some details on the Combine itself. Here’s a transcript of our interview with Chris Falsetta. ***  New Canaanite: Chris, I want to hear about what will happen Sunday at the Combine—where should people go, what time, what will they see? But first, you and I connected many months ago about this day. Now that we are just one week away, how are you feeling?  Chris Falsetta: I feel terrific about the event. I feel even better about the people that have been involved in the event. The volunteers of people on the Gracie Fund board, the sponsors, the donors. The response has been unbelievable. The school, the doctors. I can keep going. But I feel very, very good about it. And I feel terrific about my partner, Rebecca Kimball at House of Telos. She is the person that’s put together what’s going to actually happen on the field, and boy, has she done a good job. Let’s talk about that. So, the Combine, as we’ve been describing it, is a competition between the police and fire departments that brings in the community, as well. And that’s fine for a description because we’ve been interviewing sponsors and others. Now let’s get into some of what actually happens on Sunday. What can people expect? So first, the Combine starts at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday morning, October 1st, at Dunning Field. When we start the event, what you’re going to see across the field are eight Combine stations. And there’ll be something we call ‘Burpee Zones,’ that’ll be the end zones at Dunning. And each Combine station has a particular activity or event that the competitors will have to do. We break them down into agility, strength, stamina and speed. You’ve got two teams of 20. You have the police team, you have the fire team. Now on those teams, half of the folks on the teams are uniformed police officers, firefighters or EMTs. The other half are locals that have joined the teams to compete with them. And we have some just terrific folks that are competing. What you’ll find is every competitor has to compete at every Combine station. And at every Combine station they compete against somebody from the other team. So imagine each station as a combination of activities. We may have the police and fire going head to head on bikes followed by flipping tires. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen the Spartan Games or things like that. They’re going to be flipping a 130-pound tire across the field. So that’ll be one event, right? You’ll see that and then you’ll see them switch to the next station and so on and so on. And I think people will want to stay for the final event. That will be a best-of -three tug-of-war. And that’ll be a lot of fun to watch. And the competitors are trying to do two things: They’re trying to win the day for their team, right? And they’re also trying to get the best time or the most points, depending on how we score that station. Because at the end of the day, we’re going to give out a team trophy, the Combine trophy itself. And we’re also going to give out best female athlete, best male athlete trophies. So there’s scorekeeping that is going on throughout the Combine at these various stations. There are simultaneous competitions happening around different areas on Dunning Field. And how long does the Combine last? How long are these competitions going on for if they start at 9:30? The Combine will run about 45 minutes. We’ll have a halftime and then it’ll run another 45 minutes. The actual Combine itself is about an hour-and-a-half of activity. At halftime, we actually have a Combine relay race between youth football players and youth softball players. We create a couple of teams and, and they’re doing something that looks a lot like what the athletes on the field are doing, but in a little bit of a streamlined way.  Among other things, the Combine is a fundraiser. The Gracie Fund for Pediatric Cancer is the beneficiary organization for the fundraising this year. How is money being raised for that cause? I’m guessing you’ve already sold things like sponsorships or merchandise or other things that are going into that fund. What about on the actual day of the Combine, is there opportunity for giving there as well?  I want to remind people that our primary goal is to host a great community event. We started with that and that’s still our primary goal. Our secondary goal is to raise awareness, and then it’s to raise money for the Gracie Fund and I think we’re going to have a successful event for all three. As far as raising money for the Gracie Fund, we have had sponsorships from many terrific businesses—national, regional, and local businesses. We’ve had individual contributors. We’ve had folks donating silent auction items. We’ve had folks buying T-shirts. Those are all the ways we’ve raised money so far. At the Combine, we’re going to give people a couple of ways to help us raise money. They can buy a T-shirt at the Combine. They can participate in the silent auction leading up to the Combine and at the Combine, and then we’re going to give people a chance to use text to donate at the Combine.  Chris, what is your understanding of the history of the Combine? For a lot of people, this is going to be the first time they’ve seen it. It sounded, in talking to Rebecca, things had been put on hold during the pandemic. The Combine started in 2018. It was a biannual event, police versus fire, and it was smaller. It was a much smaller event, never done at Dunning Stadium. Usually done in an indoor venue and the primary purpose of the Combine when Rebecca started it was really to get the police and fire folks together and to just do what we’re hoping to do also, which is to invite locals to come out and get to mingle with their first responders and just, just have a nice morning. We’ve taken that a step further with the combine this year. I think it was probably because of my family’s circumstances and what we saw as a major unmet need and the chance for the Combine to unite the community a little bit. We went ahead with making it, I think, a more involved, larger event, something that’s tailored a little more to spectators. That’s great. What would you say, Chris, to someone who has been hearing about the Combine and the Gracie Fund throughout the summer and is thinking about maybe coming and checking it out, but isn’t maybe totally sure about their plans for next Sunday? Frst, please come. The Combine is only a successful event if people come out. It’s free and it’s great for families. This is going to be something I think the kids are going to have a good time, so come on out. There’s no tickets. You can come out and see what you think. And you don’t have to be there the whole time if you don’t want to, but I think once you get there and you see what’s going on, you’re going to want to stay. Keep in mind that, if you want to come, a little before the Combine starts, Dunkin’ is providing donuts and coffee for the crowd at 9 o’clock. That was something that the police asked us to do, because they thought it’d be kind of fun to mingle with the townsfolk. Is there anything else that we haven’t talked about, with respect to the Combine, that you’d like to tell our readers about? I would like to let everyone know that our silent auction just went live, Sundy, and you’ll see some messages on our socials about it Monday morning. There are unbelievable items and vacations and all sorts of things and experiences donated by families and businesses in town. Please visit our auction site. Please register and think about bidding. I think there’s some great stuff on there. +: great cause. -: assault bike. Friends: watch me compete! Enemies: watch me suffer! Let’s get it on!!!! And please donate, donate, donate to a vital cause. Amazing event Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment  Name

Scraped article text: Information via Hoyt Funeral Home Roma E. Le Blanc Sr. died peacefully in the hospital, surrounded by family and friends, on Thursday, September 21, 2023. He was 80 years old. He was survived by his sons, Roma Jr (Karen), Michael (Jennifer), and his grandsons, Jake, Louis, and Mason, as well as many nieces, nephews, great-nieces, and great nephews. He was the youngest of 13 and predeceased by his siblings as well as his wife of 54 years, Phyllis Le Blanc. Roma was born in Wedgeport, Canada and has spent his adult life in New Canaan, CT. He loved both countries and recently enjoyed what he called "a trip of a lifetime" back home to Canada, accompanied by his son, Michael. He was a plant operator for the town of New Canaan, retiring after 34 years of dedicated service. Roma was known as a true friend to all who knew him. He was there for everyone and always managed to find the time to help anyone who asked him. He was a generous soul who would offer the shirt off his back to someone in need. He never had a lot but was always happy and grateful for what he had. He loved to spend time with his family and to keep busy and even in retirement he never stopped. He enjoyed being outside and working with his hands. His joy in life was his grandchildren. A part of Roma was missing since he lost Phyllis in April. His family hopes he has found peace now. There will be a gathering to remember Roma E. Le Blanc Sr. at Hoyt Funeral Home in New Canaan, CT, On Friday the 29th of September. Family will be available from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. There will be a dinner afterward at The Norwalk Inn at 7:30 p.m. for those who wish to attend. Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox.

Four teams ranked in last week’s Top 10 lost during Week 3, two of which happened in “can-you-believe-this” fashion. The fallout from all the chaos is that Bloomfield, New Canaan and Staples all make their season debuts in the Top 10 this week.

 NEW CANAAN, CT — The inaugural "Howloween Dog Parade" is set to take place during New Canaan's Halloween Block Party next month. According to a news release provided by Rock Paper Scissors Custom Events, the block party is scheduled to take place Oct. 29, during which kids, parents and grandparents can stroll in costume down Elm Street, which will be closed to traffic from noon until 2 p.m. New for 2023, the dog parade offers an opportunity for residents' furry friends to get involved. Set to take place between 1:30 p.m. and 1:50 p.m., pet pantry prizes will be offered for costumed dogs. Prize categories include: Pre-registered dogs will meet at The Morena Clock on Elm Street for check in. Entries are limited to 25. The dogs and owners will then walk down to the Shade Store and parade back for the panel of experts to award prizes. Guest judges include Kristen Schilo, the "Dog Whisperer" from New Canaan Dogs, Michael Konstantaras, owner of Bark Busters and renowned author James Frey. "Spooktators" are also highly encouraged. The event, sponsored by Pet Pantry Warehouse and supported by the New Canaan Chamber of Commerce, is produced by Rachel Lampen and Kristen Mitrakis from Rock Paper Scissors Custom Events. More information on how to enter a dog is available here. Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.

	 NewCanaanite.com recently received the following letter(s) of endorsement. We will publish endorsement letters from New Canaan residents through Oct. 24. Please send them to editor@newcanaanite.com. *** Dear New Canaan Residents, I am writing to endorse Amy Murphy Carroll for First Selectman. Having had the privilege of collaborating with Amy for the past three years on the New Canaan Board of Finance, I can wholeheartedly attest to her contributions to our community through her unwavering dedication and exceptional performance. Amy’s professional expertise in finance shines through in her every action. Her deep understanding of financial matters has been honed through years of professional experience, ensuring that she approaches every decision with a well-informed perspective. This knowledge has been invaluable in navigating the complexities of municipal finance, leading to fiscally responsible outcomes for our town. Amy’s commitment to civility and respect stands as a testament to her character. She understands the importance of constructive dialogue and remains focused on the issues that truly matter to our residents. Amy will ensure town committee assignments, board positions, and leadership roles are open to all citizens — regardless of political affiliation. It is my opinion that Amy’s professional experience (30 year career covering municipal financings on Wall Street most recently at JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley), and her volunteer experience in town (10 years on the Board of Finance, and her work on the Saxe building committee and Police Department building committee to name a few) make her an ideal choice for First Selectman. I urge you to cast your vote for Amy Murphy Carroll to ensure a prosperous and responsible future for New Canaan. Sincerely, Victor Alvarez *** Amy Murphy Carroll’s election as First Selectman would bring a style of leadership to town government that reflects her devotion to governing in a way that is collaborative and open, reflecting her campaign’s theme of unifying the town as “One New Canaan.” Along with that approach, she is deeply knowledgeable about New Canaan’s fiscal position, having served on the Board of Finance. More broadly, in her professional career, she has worked in municipal finance at major institutions as an investment industry professional. As First Selectman, Carroll wants to govern in a way that brings the town together as a community, rather than divides it. As she said in a recent interview: “We all have the common goals of maintaining our world class schools and our amazing town amenities supported by our topnotch Public Works Department.” In her commitment to be a unifying agent, she wants to draw on the town’s “informed, engaged electorate,” to be partners in government so that the First Selectman is seen as a “steward for the town, not just one person’s or one party’s priorities,” as she said in an interview. When asked in public forums about issues such as affordable housing or the renovation plan for the police station, it’s clear that her knowledge of town government is deep. A graduate of Cornell University, Amy has an MBA from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. She knows the numbers in detail, a product of her education, career and of having applied that knowledge to serving for nearly a decade on the Board of Finance. In keeping with her “One New Canaan” outlook, she has devoted her time to many New Canaan civic activities, among them St. Mark’s White Elephant, on which she served as chair several times; managing numerous youth sports teams, and launching Bring Your Own Bag New Canaan. In addition, she has served on multiple town task forces.  Her combination of wanting to serve New Canaan with openness, transparency and collaboration, coupled with a depth of expertise in municipal finance drawn from her career and from having served on the Board of Finance would make her an outstanding First Selectman for our town. Susan B. Edmands and Douglas P. Walker *** Dear Editor: If elected to the Town Council, Janet Fonss and Jennifer Zonis would bring an abiding interest in doing what’s best for New Canaan. Knowing them, Fonss and Zonis, both long-term town residents, would forge a path that maintains and elevates New Canaan’s commitment to its deservedly praised schools. Further, they would participate in Council discussions in a way that fosters civility and make their decisions transparently, guided by serving the public interest. Zonis, who grew up in town, and Fonss, a 24-year resident, followed up successful professional careers by dedicating their expertise and time on behalf of town programs too numerous to mention. Zonis has been president of New Canaan’s Interfaith Council for nearly five years, has collaborated with the New Canaan Library and New Canaan Museum and has enjoyed reviewing grants for the New Canaan Community Foundation. Fonss has been an active volunteer in the schools, variously serving as West Elementary School’s co-PTC president, and also been a classroom coordinator, a fundraising chair for school-related projects, and a Board member.  Zonis describes herself as one of New Canaan’s biggest champions, a unifier, someone who has always worked hard, studied issues, listened to others and been able to collaborate to reach the most beneficial solutions. Fonss, who expresses gratitude for New Canaan’s quality of life and the friendships she enjoys in town, said the town’s core is built on service, community and shared goals.  Together, their depth of intelligence and dedication to public service, deserves to be represented on the Town Council. They are committed to making their decisions based on substance, facts and, most important, what would be best for New Canaan. As residents, we would be extremely well-served by their thoughtful approach to reaching decisions. Residents would be kept apprised during the decision-making process and when on the Council, Zonis and Fonss would always be guided by what would be most beneficial for the town as a whole. We enthusiastically endorse Jennifer Zonis and Janet Fonss for Town Council and urge New Canaan residents to vote for both of these extremely qualified candidates.  Cynthia Dul and John Matz Your email address will not be published.

	 October 8-14, 2023 is National Fire Prevention week. This year’s focus is “Cooking Safety starts with YOU. Pay attention to fire prevention.” Fire Marshal Paul Payne. Credit: Michael Dinan Cooking related fire is one of the most common causes of home fires (not to mention automatic alarms!).  Following are a few tips on cooking safety so your meals can be as uneventful as they are delicious: Many cooking fires occur when pots are placed on the stove to warm and then we get distracted by a phone call, a child calling or an interesting home repair show. To help avoid this set the timer for 3 – 5 minutes as a reminder to come back and check. If a pot catches fire NEVER carry the pot to the sink, outdoors, etc. because as you walk the flames are coming right back towards you. Some folks have home fire extinguishers but great care must be exercised when using them on a flaming pot of oil. The agent discharges with great force and if pointed directly into the pot will cause it to spread all over (also the powder from the extinguisher makes a HUGE mess!). The best solution is to leave the pot where it is, put on an oven mitt and carefully cover the pan with its lid and turn off the heat source. If you don’t have the lid a flat cookie sheet will do the same thing – smother the fire.  Never remove the lid until the pot has cooled down substantially. Last, never use water on a hot grease fire, the resulting steam explosion will propel the burning oil throughout the kitchen. Another common problem is turning on your self-cleaning oven without first cleaning heavy accumulations from the oven floor. As the oven heats up some of this product begins to burn and fill the kitchen with smoke. The good news is that this is not a big problem – the fire will not leave the oven. The bad news is that it will set off the smoke detectors (or you fire alarm system, if you have one) and smoke up the house. Turn off the oven and wait for it to cool down (you will not be able to open the oven until the temperature drops to a safe level). Less common problems are items left on stoves that don’t belong and then the stove is turned on. Another is storing items in the oven that are combustible, usually something plastic which will make a big mess and smell horribly. Finally, never hesitate to call 911 for a cooking fire; even if you think you have extinguished it fully.  Fire Fighters will respond to verify that everything is safe and the fire is completely extinguished. For additional questions regarding kitchen fire safety or, any other fire safety questions please contact the Fire Marshal’s Office at 203-594-3030 Your email address will not be published.

Scraped article text: WELLESLEY ISLAND, New York (WWNY) - On Sunday, September 24, The Rev’d John Day Andersen, Sr. a beloved uncle, father, grandfather, great grandfather, friend and lifelong minister, passed away at his home in Thousand Island Park, NY on Wellesley Island. Jack, as he was known by all, spent his life devoted to his family, the Episcopal Church, and the community he treasured, Thousand Island Park. Born to Robert Julius and Arlene Margaret Day Andersen in Auburn, NY on May 29, 1933. Jack just celebrated his ninetieth birthday with friends and family this past summer. Jack’s ministry spanned nearly 60 years, beginning as a chaplain’s assistant in the United States Army Paratroopers 11th Airborne Div. before graduating from William Hobart College with a BA in 1960 and subsequently receiving a degree in Theology from Berkeley Divinity School in 1963. He then served parishioners at St. John’s Episcopal in Greenwich and St. Mark’s Episcopal in New Canaan, CT, before becoming the executive director of Roslyn Episcopal Retreat Center in Richmond, Virginia in 1972. He went on to found ECCC (Episcopal Camps and Conference Centers) and led that effort until his retirement in 2005. He became vicar of the Church of Saint Lawrence in Alexandria Bay, NY in 2003 and has been active in the Episcopal Diocese of Central New York for the past twenty years. His pastoral care, sincere friendship and spiritual guidance were gifts to many families for whom he has officiated baptisms, weddings, and funerals. He was particularly honored to have served as chairman of the board and general manager of Thousand Island Park, reflecting his devotion to the preservation and betterment of the community. He is survived by his son, John Andersen, Jr. (Susan), daughter, Deborah Andersen (Steve Pullinger), grandson Robert Andersen (Devin), granddaughter Jennifer Andersen (Garret Plummer), step-grandson Jeffrey Pullinger (Erin), step-granddaughter Lisa Woodcock (Justin), great grandchildren Jackson, Cameron, Anna, Emmy, Henry and Lucy, his beloved nephew Michael Andersen ( grandnephew Roy and grandniece Katy), special friend Ruth Sugeno, and many lifelong friends and neighbors. In addition to his parents, he is preceded in death by his wife, Janet Lewis Andersen, brother, Robert (Bob) Andersen Jr. and nephew Robert “Buzz” Andersen III. Calling hours will be Friday, September 29th from 4-7PM at Cummings Funeral Service, Inc. in Clayton, NY. The funeral will be held at Church of Saint Lawrence in Alexandria Bay, NY on Saturday, September 30th at 2:00PM with The Right Reverend Dr. DeDe Duncan-Probe officiating. Burial will follow at Riverside Cemetery, Wellesley Island, NY. In lieu of flowers, please consider donating to the Church of Saint Lawrence, P.O.Box 211 Alexandria Bay NY 13607 or Wellesley Island Fire Department. P.O. Box 690 Wellesley Island NY 13640.

Scraped article text: NEW CANAAN, CT — New Canaan High School is among the best public schools in America, according to new rankings from the education platform Niche. Niche’s 2024 Best Schools and Districts rankings include data on 94,058 public schools, 30,809 private schools and 12,192 school districts. This year’s rankings include 7,375 newly ranked public schools. New Canaan High School ranked first on the list, just above Staples and Wilton high schools. Below are the top 25 public high schools in Connecticut, according to Niche: You can view the full rankings here. In addition to ranking No. 1 overall in Connecticut, New Canaan High School also ranked No. 100 out of 21,129 schools in the country for athletes. Niche said its rankings, now in the ninth year, differ from others that rely almost exclusively on test scores and academic performance in that it also includes input from students, alumni and parents, as well as quantitative data from sources such as the U.S. Department of Education to evaluate teachers, resources and facilities. The company said its rankings were created to provide families with valuable information — both quantitative and qualitative — on schools in their area or in a neighborhood they’re not familiar with yet. As in previous years, the Best Schools rankings include categories for boarding, charter and magnet schools as well as schools for STEM and the arts among many others.

	 Police late Sunday arrested a New Canaan man, 47, and woman, 46, involved in a domestic incident. At about 10:57 p.m. on Sept. 24, officers were dispatched to a Lakeview Avenue home on a report of dispute that involved both individuals. Following an investigation, police brought the misdemeanor charges. It’s unclear what happened, whether a third person was involved as a victim or what were the extent of that injuries. Police declined to provide details, calling it a domestic matter. A person is guilty of third-degree assault, according to state law, when “with intent to cause physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person” or “recklessly causes serious physical injury to another person or “with criminal negligence, he causes physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon, a dangerous instrument or an electronic defense weapon,” among other reasons. The man and woman were released after promising to appear Monday in state Superior Court. The Domestic Violence Crisis Center in Stamford provides services, support and education for the prevention and elimination of domestic violence. Its 24-hour hotline is 888-774-2900. To reach DVCC offices during regular business hours, the number is 203-588-9100. Services are free and confidential, multilingual and multicultural.

	 The town is poised to start a major paving project next week, encompassing many of the roads along the South Avenue-Main Street corridor. Public Works Director told members of the Board of Selectmen during their most recent meeting that he’s hoping the approximately $1.6 million paving project starts Oct. 1 so that it’s wrapped up well ahead of Thanksgiving. The town is to be reimbursed by utility companies for paving that will include Farm Road, South Avenue, Brooks Road, Crystal Street, Elm Place, Grace Street, Hawthorne Road, Kelly Green, Leslie Lane, Meadow Lane, Orchard Lane, Park Place, Selleck Place, Whitney Avenue, Woodland Road, Autumn Lane, Douglas Road, Fairty Drive, Orchard Drive, Southwood Drive, Tommy’s Lane, Green Avenue, Maple Street, Oak Street, Locust Avenue and Grove Street. The town is hiring Norwalk-based FGB Construction to do the work, and will be reimbursed by Eversource and Aquarion, Mann said. “There’s certain aspects in here that we do pay for,” Mann said during the Board’s Sept. 19 meeting, held at Town Hall and via videoconference. “We pay for the police protection and we pay for the mobilization, small items like that. But they pay for the milling and the paving, the large items.” First Selectman Kevin Moynihan and Selectmen Kathleen Corbet and Nick Williams voted 3-0 in favor of the $1,639,522 contract.  The approval comes as the town seeks to repave roads that were opened up in order for Aquarion to install a 36-inch water line from the Wilton line to the area of Farm and South, among other projects.  Asked about the status of Harrison Avenue, Mann said that Aquarion “had a leak in the 36-inch water line.” “When they pressurized it, they had a leak, and it’s taken them about a month,” Mann said. “They had to bring in a special company to come in and find it. Last week they found it, and they’ve been working this week on sealing that, what they hope is just this one leak. It’s very small, it’s in a weld. But obviously they’ve got to meet tests.” Mann added that “hopefully there’s not another leak further up the hill, because this one’s located very close to Main Street.” “At that point in time, they’ll fill it, chlorinate it, and then we can come in and we can pave it,” he said. “So we’re waiting.” The town also has to wait for the road to “settle,” Moynihan said. Mann said the town might “put a thin shim course over the top” of Harrison and “let it sit for the winter,” adding that Little Brook Road may be in the same category “because there’s been so much work on the roads.” “And we’re working right now on who would pay for that—whether it would be the town or whether it would be Aquarion,” Mann said. “My opinion is that Aquarion should help us go through this because they dug up the road so poorly, so much, that they should take over that idea. Because the thought is if we come in and we and we repave it and she settles over the winter, nobody wins at that point in time. We have to come back out and do it again. We’re in discussions right now as to how to proceed on that.” We are so thrilled, these roads have been a mess! Great news ! Hopefully the plan calls for fixing the unsightly broken curbs as well. Many were broken during the gas line installation. What about Spring Hill it’s the worst road in this town. Don’t forget about us Your email address will not be published.
